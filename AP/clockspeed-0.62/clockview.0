[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1mclockview[0m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mclockview  [22mreads  a  TAI64NA time adjustment.  It then prints the local
       UNIX clock and the local UNIX clock plus that adjustment.

       The adjustment must be a single 16-byte packet.

       Both clocks are printed in ISO style  (with  nanoseconds  and  attosec-
       onds),  in the local time zone, using [1mlocaltime[22m.  Beware that many sys-
       tems do not handle leap seconds correctly in [1mlocaltime[22m.
