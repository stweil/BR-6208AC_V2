[1mNAME[0m
       sntpclock - check a system's clock through NTP

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1msntpclock [4m[22mhost[0m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1msntpclock  [22mconnects  to  an NTP server on [4mhost[24m.  [4mhost[24m must be a dotted-
       decimal IP address.

       [1msntpclock [22mprints a 16-byte TAI64NA adjustment that, when added  to  the
       local UNIX clock, will produce the TAI clock on [4mhost[24m.  [1msntpclock [22mlimits
       the adjustment to 2 days.

       [1msntpclock [22mdoes not bind to port 123; this means that it does  not  need
       to  run  as  root.   Note that some firewalls will not permit [1msntpclock[0m
       requests.

[1mNOTES[0m
       An NTP timestamp is a count of  non-leap  seconds.   [1msntpclock  [22muses  a
       local  leap-second  table  to  convert the NTP timestamp to TAI with an
       epoch of 1970-01-01 00:00:10 TAI.  For a discussion of  the  difference
       between UTC and TAI see [1mhttp://pobox.com/~djb/proto/utctai.html[22m.

       The current NTP time scale will break down in 2036.
