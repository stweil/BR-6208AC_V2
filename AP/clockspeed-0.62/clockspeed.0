clockspeed(1)                                                    clockspeed(1)



[1mNAME[0m
       clockspeed - speed up or slow down the local clock, continuously

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1mclockspeed[0m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mclockspeed [22mresets the local UNIX clock every three seconds according to
       (1) an internal hardware tick counter and (2) occasional real-time mea-
       surements from a reliable source.

       [1mclockspeed  [22mreads  the  real-time  measurements  from [1m/usr/local/clock-[0m
       [1mspeed/adjust[22m.  Each real-time measurement  must  be  a  single  16-byte
       packet, expressed as a TAI64NA time adjustment to the local UNIX clock.

       [1mclockspeed [22mdoes not place any limits on the possible  adjustments.   It
       is your responsibility to make sure that the measurements are reliable.

       After two real-time measurements, [1mclockspeed [22mcan figure out the  number
       of  real  attoseconds per tick.  It saves this number in TAI64NA format
       in   [1m/usr/local/clockspeed/etc/atto[22m,   overwriting    [1m/usr/local/clock-[0m
       [1mspeed/etc/atto.tmp   [22mfor   reliability.    It  reads  [1m/usr/local/clock-[0m
       [1mspeed/etc/atto [22mwhen it starts up again.
